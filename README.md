A clean, responsive portfolio site using the [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) framework and lovingly designed by Reid Sox-Harris.

That's a lie, there was way more spite than love involved. 
Safari will never get the best of me with its ever-so-slightly different implementation of the HTML spec.
I'm going to be honest here, frontend web development is not my forte, and that stuff is *hard*. 
But I learned a lot, and that's what matters, right?

## What's Involved
* [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/): Static site generation
* [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/): Easy (well, easier) CSS framework
* [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/): CI/CD and hosting
* [Prettier](https://prettier.io/): Consistently opinionated styling
* [ESLint](https://eslint.org/): Linter and constant reminder I don't know JS well enough
